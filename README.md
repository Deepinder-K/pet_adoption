PROJECT - PET ADOPTION 


![image](https://github.com/Deepinder-K/pet_adoption/assets/158999108/6896a1a7-9e38-48b7-926b-356d2e61117a)


Pet adoption is the process whereby a person brings an animal, mostly cats and dogs, to their own care. These pets that are either lost or abandoned are taken by the animal control to be kept in animal shelters. Pets that are kept in the shelters for a long time are euthanized to reduce the number of over population of unwanted animals.The inspiration of this project is a web-based adoption site for people to be more aware of stray animals waiting to be adopted. The website is accessible for users and administrators where users can register themselves into the system to view the list of animals waiting to be adopted along with each animal’s records such as their (estimated) age, gender, and their description. The administrators are the main authority of the system and they are responsible for adding, editing, updating, and deleting information if necessary.


Problem Definition

• Pets’s Profile:  
Most shelter animals have a reputation of being aggressive animals that roam around the streets and are taken in by the animal control because of their wild behavior. Therefore, our project has focused on presenting the user with each animal’s personality descriptions to gain the user’s interest to adopt the Pet.

• Unqualified Adopter:
When an animal is adopted by a person, most organizations do not take caution on whether the animal is taken in by good hands. Therefore a personality evaluation must be taken before someone adopts an animal.

• Information Retrieval:
Pet adoption shelters usually ask the adopter for their contact information but never actually keep in contact with the people who adopt the animals, especially when their records are difficult to retrieve because they are kept as hardcopies


Scope of the Project

• User registration:
This function allows the user to register as a member to interact with the system. The system requires the user to log-in before going through other processes.

• User must answer the questionnaire:
After registering into the system, it is mandatory for the user to fill in the
questionnaire about their background, interests, life style and history of raising a pet.

• Data is input and updated by the administrators:
All Pet’s records are input and updated by the administrators. Animal records such as their name, breed, gender, approximate age, coat color and size.

• View information online:
The user can view the records of animals in the shelter by going through categories and lists; our system has three separated categories: Cats, Dogs, and Animals with Special needs. The user can also view information about the shelter and also where to contact the shelter.

• Adoption requests:
The user can select the animal they want to adopt and send a request through the system which will then notify the administrator of a new adoption request. The administrator will have to review the questionnaire the user has previously answered to see whether they are capable of adopting an animal or not.

FRONTEND TECHNOLOGIES

HTML:
HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. It forms the backbone of the World Wide Web by providing a structured and semantic framework for organizing content. HTML uses tags to define elements within a document, specifying their structure and presentation.

Uses of HTML:

1. Web Page Structure: HTML is primarily used to structure the content of a web page. It defines the basic structure, layout, and elements of a webpage.
2. Hyperlinks: HTML allows you to create hyperlinks, enabling users to navigate between different web pages easily.
3. Multimedia Integration: HTML supports the embedding of multimedia elements such as images, audio, and video.
4. Forms: HTML provides form elements to collect user input, like text fields, buttons, checkboxes, and more.
5. Semantic Markup: HTML includes semantic tags that provide meaning to the content, making it more accessible and search engine-friendly.


CSS:
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): CSS is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.
It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of a webpage.
Separation of Concerns: CSS allows the separation of content (HTML) and presentation (CSS), making it easier to maintain and update the visual aspects of a website.

Uses of CSS:

1. Styling HTML Elements: CSS is primarily used to style HTML elements, providing control over the visual presentation of a webpage.
2. Layout Control: It enables the positioning and layout of elements on a page, helping create responsive and visually appealing designs.
3. Color and Typography: CSS allows the definition of colors, fonts, and text styling, enhancing the visual aesthetics of the content.
4. Responsive Design: With CSS, web developers can create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
5. Animations and Transitions: CSS supports animations and transitions, allowing for dynamic and interactive elements on a webpage.


   
BOOTSTRAP:
Bootstrap is a free and open-source frontend development framework for the creation of websites and web apps. The Bootstrap framework is built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS) to facilitate the development of responsive, mobile-first sites and apps.

Features of Bootstrap:

1. Easy to Begin With :
It is pretty easy, to begin with. Being easy to get started with is probably the first quality which makes Bootstrap very appealing.
2. LESS as Well as CSS Files :
Bootstrap not only offers LESS files but also includes the old CSS files.
3. Easily Customizable :
Despite the fact that Bootstrap is designed in responsive 12-column grids, layouts, and components, it is also very easy to customize. Whether you need a fixed grid or a responsive one, it can be made possible by making a few changes. Offsetting and nesting of columns are also easy to do in both CPU-based and mobile-based browser grids.
4. Responsive Utility Classes :
Another prominent feature of Bootstrap is its responsive utility classes. Using responsive utility classes, a particular piece of content can be made to appear or hide only on devices depending on the size of the screen being used. This feature is extremely helpful for designers who want to make a mobile and tablet-friendly version of their websites.



JAVASCRIPT :
JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities. JavaScript was first known as Live Script, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name Live Script. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers. Client-Side JavaScript.

Advantages of JavaScript :
1. Less server interaction − You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.
2. Immediate feedback to the visitors − They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.
3. Increased interactivity − You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.
4. Richer interfaces − You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.

REACT :
React, developed by Facebook, is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Launched in 2013, React has become a cornerstone in modern web development due to its declarative approach and component-based architecture. It allows developers to efficiently create interactive and dynamic UIs, making it a preferred choice for single-page applications (SPAs) and complex web applications.

Advantages of React:
1. Composable: We can divide these codes and put them in custom components. Then we can utilize those components and integrate them into one place.
2. Declarative: In ReactJS, the DOM is declarative. We can make interactive UIs by changing the state of the component and ReactJS takes care of updating the DOM according to it.
3. SEO Friendly: ReactJS affects the SEO by giving you a SPA (Single Page Application) which requires Javascript to show the content on the page which can be rendered and indexed.
4. Community: ReactJS has a huge community because of its demand each company wants to work with ReactJS. Companies like Meta, Netflix, etc built on ReactJS.
5. Easy to learn: HTML-like syntax of JSX makes you comfortable with the codes of React, it only requires a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS fundamentals to start working with it.

NODE JS :
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment designed to execute JavaScript code outside a web browser. It enables server-side scripting and facilitates the development of scalable, high-performance web applications. Released in 2009, Node.js has gained widespread popularity due to its event-driven architecture and non-
blocking I/O model, making it particularly well suited for building real-time applications and APIs.

Features of Node.js:

1. Fast Execution: Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine from Google, renowned for its speed and efficiency. This allows Node.js applications to execute quickly and handle a large number of simultaneous connections.
2. Scalability: The event-driven, non-blocking architecture makes Node.js highly scalable. It efficiently handles concurrent requests, making it suitable for applications that require high scalability, such as chat applications and online gaming platforms.
3. Large Ecosystem: Node.js has a vast and active ecosystem of open-source packages available through npm (Node Package Manager). This extensive library of modules simplifies development and accelerates the creation of robust applications.
4. JavaScript Everywhere: With Node.js, developers can use JavaScript both on the client and server sides. This allows for a more seamless development process and code reuse between Front-end and back-end components.
